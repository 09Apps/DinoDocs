# DinoDocs
Dinosaur quiz iOS app : https://dinodocapp.wordpress.com/
Challenge yourself with the questions collected from Dinosaur fans around the world and have fun while getting to know more about these creatures.

For curious minds, there are many quizzes inside the app; a generic Explorer quiz is supplied for more basic information about dinosaurs, as well as separate quiz for specific species of the dinosaurs. The app features quizes for Ankylosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, T-Rex and Velociraptor. It tests knowledge of the users for each of these species of dinosaurs. So whatever your favorite is, bring it on!

The word "DinoDoc" is derived from "Dinosaur Doctor" - the one who knows everything about the Dinosaurs. Users can earn badges by solving the quizzes and also earn a title. Each badge has a beautiful design that complements each users achievement. Earning more badges levels up their title, and even respectfully calls you a "Dr." if you reach certain level.
